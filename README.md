# List Sorter

This Java project focuses on practicing list manipulation and sorting algorithms. It includes implementations of the bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort algorithms.

## Features
- Implementation of bubble sort algorithm
- Implementation of selection sort algorithm
- Implementation of insertion sort algorithm
- Demonstration of list manipulation and sorting techniques

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files:

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Selection Sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the sorted sublist.
- Insertion Sort: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.
